# easy-mock-server
Easy way to create mock server and can be used in concourse-ci

Standalone mock service application built for pipeline usage
Javalin open source API web tool is used to create mock responses
URL, Request, Response conditions can be updated in excel sheet.
Mock service excel data will be uploaded in source code
On pipeline, excel sheet will be used as data source for mock services.
Application will be configured to point mock service which will be running
in localhost
EasyMock is an idea and this can be replaced with any mock services
in pipeline
